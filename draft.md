### At a glance - What's AO3? How does it operate? Why does it need donations? And why is it in beta?

#### Why does AO3 exist?

   - AO3 was created because there was no place on the internet where fanfiction was truly free from persecution based on political or religious beliefs.

   - You can read more about AO3 and its purpose in [What is the Archive of Our Own?](https://archiveofourown.org/faq/about-the-archive?language_id=en#whatisao3)

   - You can read more about the OTW and our vision in [What We Believe](http://www.transformativeworks.org/what_we_believe/)



#### How is AO3 coded?

   - AO3 is an open source project built in Ruby on Rails. Anyone can view our code on [Github](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive) and submit pull requests for [open issues](https://otwarchive.atlassian.net/projects/AO3/issues).

   - AO3 is hosted on (James please write a sentence about the servers here...)



#### Why is AO3 still in beta?
   
   - Beta simply indicates that the site is still a work in progress, and will continue to evolve as we tackle ongoing issues and implement more features that align with our original vision for the archive.



#### How is AO3 maintained?

   - AO3 and its parent organisation, the OTW, are nonprofit, built and maintained by a workforce of unpaid volunteers. This includes everyone from the coders to the lawyers. You can read more about our volunteers and check for open positions at [OTW - Volunteer](http://www.transformativeworks.org/volunteer/)



#### How does AO3 raise money?
   
   - The OTW accepts donations year round, but we also host regular fundraisers to raise money for AO3 and for our [other projects](http://www.transformativeworks.org/our-projects/) such as Fanlore and Open Doors to name a few.

   - Another sentence here written by devmem or someone informed about the average size of a donation and any other notable details about the fundraising process.



#### How much does it cost for AO3 to operate? Can I see where donations go?

   - We detail where donation money goes in our annual [budget spreadsheets](http://www.transformativeworks.org/committees/finance-committee/)

   - Some stats and information written by someone knowledgeable on the subject, about how much the servers cost, how much traffic we get, how many works we host and why all of this adds up to the amount that it does

   - While professional help is sometimes employed for large-scale code overhauls (or something), the OTW's volunteers never pocket your donation money. Leftover proceeds are lovingly set aside and spared for when donations come short.



#### Instead of donations, why not host ads?

   - Hosting advertisements means catering to advertisers' wishes. This means that if, for example, advertisers decided they want to do away with all LGBTQA+ content on AO3, suddenly all existing and future works that included LGBTQA+ content would be subject to deletion.

   - Hosting advertisements can also mean selling our users' data and browsing preferences to advertisers so they can better target your interests and show you ads you're more likely to click on.

   - You can read more about our stance on advertisements and data privacy in our [Terms of Service](https://archiveofourown.org/tos).



#### Instead of hosting everything, why not filter out content that may trigger some people?

   - We do not censor content on AO3 that is both legal in the United States and in line with our [content policy](https://archiveofourown.org/tos#content). Sensitive content is tagged with appropriate [content warnings](https://archiveofourown.org/tos#IV.K.), and by using [exclusion filters](https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/10575), you can filter out any potentially triggering works that you do not want to see. If you come across a work that focuses a sensitive topic but lacks the appropriate content warnings, you may report it to [Abuse](https://archiveofourown.org/abuse_reports/new).
